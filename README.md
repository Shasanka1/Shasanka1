- 👋 Hi, I’m Shasanka Nudurupati, and I am currently a student at UCSD studying the field of Mathmatics-Computer Science. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about SWE tools and technologies from implementation in production pipline code to ML/NLP research of the modules
that are used by such language to many fields like Blockchain Technology from Smart Contract and EVM environment.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python programming from  different modules being used in all applications of this languge. 
From data science analysis to game design and everything inbetween. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational/ML related research projects. This way, I will be able to practically learn, contribute effeciently, 
and collaborate with others in a way that helps me learn while being able to develop to a greater impact in the field.
